# Data Science Portfolio

Here are some of my best Data Science Projects. I have explored various machine-learning algorithms for different datasets. Feel free to contact me to learn more about my experience working with these projects.

[Examining the effect of environmental factors and weather on demand of Bike rentals](https://github.com/jennadof/linearPoject.git)

<img src="images/seoul-bikes.jpeg?raw=true"/>

**Skills used:** Python, Pandas, SKlearn, Matplotlib

**Project Objective:** Predicting Bike rental demand on basis of weather and seasonal factors in advance to take appropiate measures which finally will result in bike utilization.

**Quantifiable result:** We could predict the Bike rental demand resulting in [*70*%** accuracy](https://github.com/suvo-gh/Bike-Rental-Demand/blob/main/Bike_Rental_Demand.ipynb).

- Used Random Forest Regressor to predict the number of bikes rented in the city of Seoul
- The data had quite a few categorical variables which were encoded for use in the model
- Encoded categorical variables to numeric using Sklearn due to the presence of many string columns
- Cross Validation for validating the training data and model fit.
- Fit a Random Forest Regressor with high prediction accuracy through iteration

[Diagnosis of breast cancer using a logistic classifier](https://github.com/jennadof/logisticregressionProjects.git)

<img src="images/breast-cancer.jpeg?raw=true"/>

**Skills used:** Python, Pandas, SKlearn, Matplotlib

**Project Objective:** Identification of the type of Breast Cancer for quicker diagnosis. This assists professionals in the medical field to take appropiate measures to accurately diagnose, treat and save lives. 

**Quantifiable result:** We could Classify the type of tumor resulting in [**82%** accuracy using K-means algorithm](https://github.com/suvo-gh/Orthopedic-Patients-Classification).

- Used logistic regression to identify a tumour as malignant or benign based on various attributes
- Classified tumors as benign or malignant by studying patterns in measured attributes of those tumors
- Used Logistic regression classifier & optimized the accuracy by using the ROC curve
- Explored a machine learning approach to medical diagnosis

[Identifying given picture is a 7 or a 3](https://github.com/jennadof/Deep-Neural-Network-project.git)

<img src="images/mnist.jpg?raw=true"/>

**Skills used:** Python, Keras, Tensorflow

**Project Objective:**Explore Deep Nueral Network with Keras for MNIST Handwritting Classification Prediction of whether a given image is  7 or  3 using Convolutional Neural Networks which may be further implemented as a feature in a bigger project.

**Quantifiable result:** We could train the Convolutional Neural Network to attain a accuracy of [**97%** using **50** epochs](https://github.com/Tech-i-s/techis-ds-wiki/blob/main/DS/Step%203-3%20Deep%20Neural%20Networks/04_Handwriting%20Recognition%20using%20DNN/step5_1_hand_writting_recognition_project.ipynb.)

- Added multiple convolution and pooling layers
- Training model on basis of given data
- Fitting the CNN to see if the provided image is 7 or 3
