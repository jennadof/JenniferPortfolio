# Data Science Portfolio

Here are some of my best Data Science Projects. I have explored various machine-learning algorithms for different datasets. Feel free to contact me to learn more about my experience working with these projects.

***
[Hand-writing recognition using CNN](https://github.com/jennadof/Deep-Neural-Network-project.git)

<img src="images/mnist.jpg?raw=true"/>

**Skills used:** Python, Keras, Tensorflow

**Project Objective:**Mnist is a Dataset with 70,000 of handwritten digits. Here I Have Predicted the mnist digits by using Convolution Neural Network**

**Quantifiable result:** We could train the Convolutional Neural Network to attain a accuracy of **97%** using **50** epochs

- Added multiple convolution and pooling layers
- Training model on basis of given data

[Predicting orthopedic persOn of Normal/abnormal Using KNN-NB](https://github.com/jennadof/logisticregressionProjects/blob/main/Knn_Nb_Project.ipynb)

<img src="images/knee-brace-ortho.png?raw=true"/>

**Skills used:** Python, Pandas, SKlearn, Matplotlib,KNN

**Project Objective:** In This Project We are provided with multiple instances of orthopedic parameters according to that i classified whether the patients are Normal or Abnormal 

**Quantifiable result:** We could Classify the Patients Normal or Abnormal with  [**82%** accuracy using K-means algorithm](https://github.com/jennadof/logisticregressionProjects/blob/main/Knn_Nb_Project.ipynb).

- Used KNN-NB to identify a patient is Normal or Abnormal .
- Classified condition of Patient as Normal or Abnormal using Multiple instances of orthopedic Parameters. 
- Explored a machine learning approach to medical diagnosis

[Predicting Whether a person interested to buy Term deposit using Logistic Regression ](https://github.com/jennadof/logisticregressionProjects.git
)

<img src="images/banking.jpeg?raw=true"/>

**Skills used:** Python, Pandas,Sklearn, Matplotlib

**Project Objective:**In this project I worked with real world data which is related with direct marketing campaigns (phone calls) of a Portuguese banking institution. The classification goal is to predict if the client will subscribe to a term deposit.**


**Quantifiable result:** We could classify whether a Person Intrested to buy term deposit or not with **98%** accuracy.

- Using Logistic Regression to Predict the behaviour of Clients
